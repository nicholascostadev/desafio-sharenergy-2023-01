# TODO

- [x] Add a Font
- [x] Add page number to dashboard
- [ ] Add fallback image to not found? Still don't know if it's needed since the CAT API already has a not found image
- [x] Add Dog API page
- [ ] Add red ring when there are any validation error
- [ ] Remove react-query devtools when finished
- [ ] See if there are any abstraction or any componentization that I can make better
  - Maybe make table accept 'rows' props instead of 'data' if it can be used later for some other table.
- [ ] Add Docs to front-end + video when finished

## Concerns

- Is there a way to search using query params on randomuser.me API?
- Would it be better if I added a footer?
- Would it be better if I changed Navbar to a Sidebar? (It's doing it's purpose right now, so maybe not)
